# Python Programming Foundations 🐍

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects developed during the **"Introduction to Programming with Python"** course by Domestika. 

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Mastered core Python syntax and logic.
* [cite_start]Implemented data structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples). [cite: 2, 5]
* [cite_start]Developed modular code using functions and control flow (Loops, Conditionals). [cite: 1, 3, 4]
* [cite_start]Used standard libraries like `datetime` for real-world applications. 

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. Exercises
* [cite_start]**basic_conditionals.py**: Logic to validate user input within specific ranges. [cite: 1]
* **data_structures_list.py**: A dynamic shopping list manager using list operations. [cite: 2]
* [cite_start]**basic_functions.py**: A multi-operation calculator demonstrating functional programming. [cite: 3]
* **loops_practice.py**: Simple automation of text repetition using `for` loops. [cite: 4]

### 2. Projects
* **Pet Store Simulator (`tienda.py`)**: A comprehensive console application that manages: 
    * [cite_start]Inventory management using Dictionaries. 
    * [cite_start]User interaction and menu-driven logic. 
    * Transaction logging with timestamps using the `datetime` module. 

## 🚀 Future Updates
* [ ] **Final Course Project**: Currently in development. To be uploaded soon!
