# Python Programming Foundations 🐍

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects developed during the **"Introduction to Programming with Python"** course by Domestika. 

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Mastered core Python syntax and logic.
* Implemented data structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples).
* Developed modular code using functions and control flow (Loops, Conditionals).
* Used standard libraries like `datetime` for real-world applications. 

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. Exercises
* [basic_conditionals.py](./Exercises/basic_conditionals.py): Logic to validate user input within specific ranges (1-100).
* [data_structures_list.py](./Exercises/data_structures_list.py): A dynamic shopping list manager using list operations and input validation.
* [basic_functions.py](./Exercises/basic_functions.py): A multi-operation calculator demonstrating functional programming and error handling.
* [loops_practice.py](./Exercises/loops_practice.py): Simple automation of text repetition using for loops.

### 2. Projects
* [pet_store_simulator.py](./Projects/pet_store_simulator.py): A comprehensive console application that manages:
    * Inventory management using Dictionaries.
    * Transaction logging with timestamps using the `datetime` module.
    * User-driven interaction menus.

## 🚀 Future Updates
* [ ] **Final Course Project**: Currently in development. To be uploaded soon!
